1. Prerequisites

•	No special tools are required, but having a basic text editor and a browser is recommended:
o	Text Editor: Use a code editor like VS Code or Sublime Text to view and edit files.
o	Browser: Ensure you have a modern browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge).


2. Clone the Repository

•	If your project is hosted in a Git repository, you can clone it:
	bash
	Copy code
	git clone <repository-url>
•	Replace <repository-url> with the actual repository URL (e.g., from GitHub).


3. Navigate to the Project Folder

•	After cloning, change to the project directory:
	bash
	Copy code
	cd <project-folder>


4. Open the Project in a Browser

•	Open it directly in your browser:
o	Option 1: Double-click the index.html file.
o	Option 2: Right-click the file and select "Open With" → Choose your browser.


5. Use a Live Server (Optional but Recommended)

•	For better development experience (e.g., auto-reloading on file changes), use a live server.
•	Steps to Set Up a Live Server:
1.	Install VS Code.
2.	Install the "Live Server" extension from the Extensions Marketplace.
3.	Open your project in VS Code.
4.	Right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server".
